# AIOS Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating various features and capabilities of the AIOS (AI Operating System) platform.

## Directory Structure

Each example is organized in its own subdirectory to avoid package conflicts and allow independent execution:

```
examples/
├── analytics-reporting/        # Analytics and reporting system demo
├── cicd-pipeline/             # CI/CD pipeline automation example
├── coding-assistant/          # AI coding assistant demonstration
├── comprehensive-testing/     # Testing framework and utilities
├── enhanced-system-integration/ # Advanced system integration patterns
├── external-data-integration/ # External data source integration
├── integration-apis/          # API integration examples
├── knowledge-management/      # Knowledge management system demo
├── project-workflow/          # Project management and workflow
├── team-collaboration/        # Team collaboration features
├── testing-demo/             # Testing demonstrations
└── workflow-automation/       # Workflow automation engine
```

## Running Examples

Each example can be run independently using:

```bash
# Run a specific example
go run examples/[example-name]/main.go

# For example:
go run examples/external-data-integration/main.go
go run examples/coding-assistant/main.go
go run examples/workflow-automation/main.go
```

## Building Examples

You can also build examples into executables:

```bash
# Build an example
go build -o bin/example-name examples/[example-name]/main.go

# For example:
go build -o bin/data-integration examples/external-data-integration/main.go
./bin/data-integration
```
