## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AIOS seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to allow us to fix them before they are publicly disclosed.

### 2. Report via Email

Send an email to: **security@aios.dev**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### 3. Report via GitHub Security Advisories

You can also report vulnerabilities through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/aios/aios/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

### 4. What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: All code is scanned with multiple security tools including:
  - Gosec for Go code
  - ESLint security rules for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - CodeQL for comprehensive analysis
  - Snyk for dependency vulnerabilities

- **Dependency Management**: 
  - Regular automated dependency updates
  - Vulnerability scanning of all dependencies
  - License compliance checking

- **Code Review**: All code changes require review by at least one maintainer

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: 
  - Minimal base images
  - Regular security scanning with Trivy and Grype
  - Non-root container execution
  - Read-only root filesystems where possible

- **Secrets Management**:
  - No hardcoded secrets in code
  - Encrypted secrets storage
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Rotation of secrets and keys

- **Network Security**:
  - TLS encryption for all communications
  - Network segmentation
  - Firewall rules and access controls

### Data Security

- **Encryption**:
  - Data encrypted at rest using AES-256
  - Data encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+
  - Database connections encrypted

- **Access Control**:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Multi-factor authentication support

- **Privacy**:
  - Local AI processing (no data leaves your system)
  - Data minimization principles
  - User control over data retention

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security

1. **Verify Downloads**: Always verify checksums and signatures
2. **Use Official Sources**: Download only from official repositories
3. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version

### Configuration Security

1. **Change Default Passwords**: Never use default credentials
2. **Use Strong Encryption Keys**: Generate secure 32-character keys
3. **Enable TLS**: Always use encrypted connections in production
4. **Limit Access**: Restrict network access to necessary ports only

### Operational Security

1. **Regular Backups**: Maintain secure, encrypted backups
2. **Monitor Logs**: Review security logs regularly
3. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies current
4. **Network Isolation**: Run in isolated network segments

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

AIOS implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Application Layer**:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Output encoding
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Session management

2. **Service Layer**:
   - API rate limiting
   - Request/response validation
   - Service-to-service authentication
   - Circuit breakers

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Container isolation
   - Network segmentation
   - Resource limits
   - Security monitoring

4. **Data Layer**:
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encrypted backups
   - Access logging
   - Data integrity checks

### Security Controls

- **Authentication**: JWT-based with configurable expiration
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for data, TLS 1.2+ for transport
- **Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## Compliance

AIOS is designed with the following compliance frameworks in mind:

- **GDPR**: Privacy by design, data minimization, user rights
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and monitoring
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Comprehensive security controls

## Security Testing

We perform regular security testing including:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
- **Container Security Scanning**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scanning**

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Contain the incident and assess impact
2. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and scope
3. **Communication**: Notify affected users and stakeholders
4. **Remediation**: Fix vulnerabilities and restore services
5. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve security measures
